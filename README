# README

fake_model allows you to replicate a non persisted ActiveRecord model
with validations. This is usefull for cases where you want validations but
do not need persistance. 

# Usage
    class person
      include FakeModel
      fake :name , :age
      validates :name , :presence => true
      validates :age , :presence => true
    end

    james = Peson.new :name => 'James' , :age => 40
    james.valid? # true
    Person.fake_attributes # [:name , :age]
    james.attributes # {:name => 'James' , :age => 40}
    james.age = 50 # true
    james.age # 50


All validations included in ActiveRecord are available.
